    description:
      'TIL was my apprentice project at Hashrocket, and it has grown into a popular dev blog with 2000+ posts, millions of page views per year, the top-ranked answers on Google to many esoteric developer questions. It is also open-source, one of the first such server-rendered Phoenix application repositories available online. I, and many members of my team, used TIL to learn Elixir and develop our growing (now well-established) Elixir practice.',
    purpose:
      "The original purpose of this application was to help me develop my skills as a programmer and consultant while completing the Hashrocket apprenticeship. TIL now exists to catalogue the sharing and accumulation of my team's knowledge as it happens day-to-day. Posts have a 200-word limit, and posting is open to any Rocketeer as well as selected friends of Hashrocket. Today I maintain the project with my fellow Rocketeers.",
    stackExplanation:
      'The original TIL was a Rails app. I initiated an Elixir rewrite because I wanted to have an Elixir project to work on and possibly get my teammates involved in.',
