      "TIL was my apprentice project at Hashrocket. It has grown into a popular developers blog with 2000+ posts, millions of page views per year, and the top-ranked answers on Google to many an esoteric developer question. It's also open-source, one of the first such Phoenix repositories online. My team and I used TIL as a vehicle to learn Elixir and develop our growing Elixir practice.",
    purpose:
      "The purpose of this application was to help me develop my skills as a programmer. Today, TIL exists to catalogue the sharing and accumulation of Hashrocket's knowledge as it happens day-to-day. Posts have a 200-word limit, and posting is open to any Rocketeer as well as selected friends of Hashrocket. I maintain the codebase, collaborating with several interested Hashrocket colleagues and alumni.",
    stackExplanation:
      'TIL launched as a Ruby on Rails app. In 2016, I initiated an Elixir rewrite because I wanted to learn Elixir and see how Phoenix stacked up against Ruby on Rails.',

      'The purpose of this project was to feel connected with other people, build something calming that defied simple explanations, and direct visitors to a charity supporting relief efforts.',
    stackExplanation:
      'The idea chose my stack: I wanted real-time, virtually unlimited connections, and Elixir with WebSockets exists for this use case. I chose Gigalixir because it offers platform-as-a-service without limitations on some core Elixir features.',
