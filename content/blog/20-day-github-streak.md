title: '20 Day Github Streak'

As of today I've pushed open-source code to Github every day for twenty days, a personal record. I don't know when I'm going to stop; most likely Thanksgiving.

Over the last twenty days, I've cleaned up my open source projects, added features to my web apps, written [TILs](http://github.com/jwworth/til), added documentation and backlinks to http://vimchi.com, and submitted merged patches to Ruby, Rails, Rust, and the Ember.js website. I'm most proud of my patch to the Silver Searcher, which allows searches to be scoped to `.rdoc` files.

This has been an exercise in pacing myself and planning ahead. I have shed every redundant step out of my process to build a pull request. With TDD, Vim and Tmux, a git naming convention that means never deleting a branch, and Github's Hub CLI, I can crank out a patch a lot faster now.

Today's patch: adding a license to 'Maine', so the terms of distribution are clear.
