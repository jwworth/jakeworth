Today I caught up on some technical blog posts that caught my eye over the week. Here's a summary of each.

- [Beyond Console Log](https://medium.com/@mattburgess/beyond-console-log-2400fdf4a9d8): a breakdown of some of the more useful alternatives to JavaScript's `console.log()`.
- [XY Problem](http://xyproblem.info/): summary of an antipattern where a person asks for help with their often misguided workaround to a problem, instead of the problem itself. I've done this, and been on the receiving end of this, many times.
- [ReasonML: Strict, powerful and forgiving](https://www.harigopal.in/talks/2018/jsfoo): slides from Hari Gopal's intro to ReasonML at JSFoo.
- [Google is using AI to help The New York Times digitize 5 million historical photos](https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/9/18079386/google-ai-new-york-times-digitize-archive-history-photos): brief overview of Google's work digitizing the vast library of New York Times images.

I'd like to give a quick plug for two newsletters I read that provided some of this content to me:

- [Inside AI](https://inside.com/ai)
- [JavaScript Weekly](https://javascriptweekly.com/)

Happy reading.
