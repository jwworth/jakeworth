Today I read some technical blog posts that caught my eye over the week. Here's
a summary of each.

- [Beyond Console Log](https://medium.com/@mattburgess/beyond-console-log-2400fdf4a9d8): a breakdown of some of the more useful alternatives to JavaScript's `console.log()`.
- [XY Problem](http://xyproblem.info/): summary of an antipattern where a
  person asks for help enacting their solution to a problem, without sharing
  the problem itself. Often the solution they are pursuing is the wrong
  solution, but they're asking the helper to start helping further down that erroneous
  road. I've done this, and been on the receiving end of this, many
  times.
- [ReasonML: Strict, powerful and forgiving](https://www.harigopal.in/talks/2018/jsfoo): slides from Hari Gopal's intro to ReasonML at JSFoo.
- [Google is using AI to help The New York Times digitize 5 million historical photos](https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/9/18079386/google-ai-new-york-times-digitize-archive-history-photos): brief overview of Google's work digitizing the vast library of New York Times images.

I'd like to give a quick plug for two newsletters I read that aggregated some of this content:

- [Inside AI](https://inside.com/ai)
- [JavaScript Weekly](https://javascriptweekly.com/)

Happy reading.
