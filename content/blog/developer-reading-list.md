Getting started as a programmer, what books should one read? These are the
programming books that I have found useful in my professional development.

Some of these books are programming classics; others are business and
team-focused. I have stolen ideas and terminology from each one that I use
every day.

Is this list complete? No. I'm still reading, and I expect to always be doing
so. I will update this list over time with new classics I discover. In that
sense, the date on this post is just the moment when I first made the list. It
will be updated.

Please reach out if you have any suggested reading for me.

### My List

- Beck, Kent and Andres, Cynthia. _Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace
  Change_. XP informs so much of modern software development that it's hard
  to grasp how revolutionary it was in its time.
- Hoover, Dave and Oshineye, Adewale. _Apprenticeship Patterns: Guidance for
  the Aspiring Software Craftsman_. This book will help anyone create a
  strategy for their early programming career.
- Hunt, Andrew and Thomas, David. _The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman
  to Master_. A broad survey of the techniques every programmer must know,
  described in useful metaphors.
- Krug, Steve. _Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web
  Usability_. A clear, concise overview of how good UI reduces the amount of
  arbitrary choices we ask of our users.
- Metz, Sandi. _Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby_. Sandi is my
  hero! Perhaps the defining introduction to Object-Oriented Programming.
- Weinberg, Gerald M. _The Secrets of Consulting: A Guide to Giving and
  Getting Advice Successfully_. Not just for consultants, but anyone who
  would like to influence a technical organization.
- Newport, Cal. _So Good They Can't Ignore You: Why Skills Trump Passion in the
  Quest for Work You Love_. Do you want to be a great programmer? This book
  makes the case that the passion we chase as professionals only comes when we
  have first put in the work to be exceptional.
- Godin, Seth. _The Dip: A Little Book That Teaches You When to Quit (and When
  to Stick)_. Starting a project or working for a startup both require an
  important soft skill: knowing when to lean in, and when to walk away.
- Godin, Seth. _Linchpin: Are You Indispensable?_ This book makes the argument
  that as more work, including programming, becomes automated, the
  professionals who will stand out in the future will be those who've mastered
  the 'soft skills'– authenticity, passion, communication– that many developers
  ignore.
- Hansson, David Heinemeier and Fried, Jason. _Remote: Office Not Required_.
  Can your team function remotely? For almost every team, yes. Should you try
  it out? Also yes.
