Getting started as a programmer, what books should one read?  This is my list
of the programming books that I think are essential for folks entering the
field.

These books are classics. They introduced ideas and terminology that changed
the discourse. I believe being aware of these seismic shifts is an important
part of doing this work.

Is this list complete? No. I'm still reading, and I expect to always be doing
so. I will update this list over time with new classics I discover. In that
sense, the date on this post is just the moment when I first made the list. It
will be updated.

Please reach out to me if you have recommended additions to this list.

### My List

- **Beck, Kent and Andres, Cynthia. _Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace
  Change_**. XP informs so much of modern software development that it's hard
  to grasp how revolutionary it was.
- **Hoover, Dave and Oshineye, Adewale. _Apprenticeship Patterns: Guidance for
  the Aspiring Software Craftsman_**. This book will help anyone create a
  strategy for their early programming career.
- **Hunt, Andrew and Thomas, David. _The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman
  to Master_**. A broad survey of the techniques every programmer must know.
- **Metz, Sandi. _Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby_.** Sandi is my
  hero! Perhaps the defining introduction to OO.
- **Weinberg, Gerald M. _The Secrets of Consulting: A Guide to Giving and
  Getting Advice Successfully_.** Not just for consultants, but anyone who
  would like to influence a technical organization.
