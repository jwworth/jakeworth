What books have shaped me as a programmer? In the post, I'd like to share my personal
developer reading list.

Some of these books are programming classics that have changed minds and the
discourse. Others focus on teams, management, communication, ethics, etc.– the
softer side of programming.

This list is not complete; I'm still reading! I will update this list over time
with new favorites I discover. In that sense, the date on this post is just the
time when I first made the list. It will continue to grow with me.

Please reach out if you have any suggested reading for me. I'm always looking
for new ideas to consider.

### My List

- Ball, Thorsten. _Writing An Interpreter In Go_. I don't think everyone should read this book. However, understanding the basic components of a programming language has been indispensable to me. Offers that expertise via a hands-on, test-driven Go project.
- Beck, Kent and Andres, Cynthia. _Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change_. XP informs so much of modern software development that it's hard to grasp how revolutionary it was in its time.
- Carr, Nicholas. _The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains_. A detailed account– good, bad, and ugly– about what we programmers are building here.
- Ford, Martin. _The Lights in the Tunnel: Automation, Accelerating Technology and the Economy of the Future_. A preview of the future of work in the face of automation.
- Godin, Seth. _Linchpin: Are You Indispensable?_ Makes the argument that as more work, including programming, becomes automated, the professionals who will stand out in the future will be those who've mastered soft skills– authenticity, passion, communication– that many developers ignore.
- Godin, Seth. _The Dip: A Little Book That Teaches You When to Quit (and When to Stick)_. Starting a project or working for a startup both require an important ability: knowing when to lean in, and when to walk away.
- Hansson, David Heinemeier and Fried, Jason. _Remote: Office Not Required_.  Can your team function remotely? For almost every team, yes. Should you try it out? Also yes.
- Hoover, Dave and Oshineye, Adewale. _Apprenticeship Patterns: Guidance for the Aspiring Software Craftsman_. Will help anyone create a strategy for their early programming career.
- Hunt, Andrew and Thomas, David. _The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master_. A broad survey of the techniques every programmer must know, described in useful metaphors.
- Isaacson, Walter. _Steve Jobs_. A gripping biography of a technology icon.
- Krug, Steve. _Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability_. A clear, concise overview of how good UI reduces the amount of arbitrary choices we ask of our users.
- Lanier, Jaron. _You Are Not a Gadget_. This is the first book I read that made me think critically about technology, and led me down a path to considering programming as a career. An impassioned plea for building a better internet.
- Metz, Sandi. _Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby_. Sandi is my hero! Perhaps the defining introduction to Object-Oriented Programming.
- Newport, Cal. _So Good They Can't Ignore You: Why Skills Trump Passion in the Quest for Work You Love_. Makes the case that the passion we chase as professionals only comes when we have first put in the work to be exceptional.
- Olsen, Russ. _Eloquent Ruby_. What is the 'Ruby Way'? Move beyond competence and into fluency.
- Simpson, Kyle. _This & Object Prototypes_. Succinctly explains some of the thornier features of JavaScript.
- Swartz, Aaron. _The Boy Who Could Change the World: The Writings of Aaron Swartz_. Thoughtful essays about technology and ethics from one of the Web's pioneers.
- Weinberg, Gerald M. _The Secrets of Consulting: A Guide to Giving and Getting Advice Successfully_. Not just for consultants, but anyone who would like to influence a technical organization.
