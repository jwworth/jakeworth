title: '40 Day Github Streak'

This week I hit 40 days of consecutive daily open source pushes to Github,
besting my previous record of 18 days. It's been an insightful endeavor, one
that I think has been beneficial to my open source programming abilities.

As a side quest I've been participating in [24 Pull
Requests](http://24pullrequests.com/). It was kind of a no-brainer considering
my already ongoing streak. I'm fascinated by the people who are adding
gamification/social to open source contribution
([Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is another example).
I will go to absurd lengths for a free programming T-shirt.

Pushing code every day has helped reinforce open source as a habit, honing my
fundamentals and eliminating inefficiencies.

In the 20 days since my last post on this subject, I've been doing lots of
documentation work. I've built
[Resources](https://github.com/jwworth/resources) into something I think is
pretty useful. I've published a few [TILs](https://github.com/jwworth/til). And
I've submitted docfixes to Ruby, Rails, Rust, Rubygems, Ember.js, JavaScript
Koans, Pry, and Free Programming Books.

I never planned to extend the streak this long, but now that I have, I don't
see a reason to stop. It's helped me to stay focused on making small,
measurable daily progress.

My streak (and its inevitable conclusion, around December 24) is being recorded
