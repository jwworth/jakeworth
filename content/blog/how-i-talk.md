I've been giving technical talks for a few years. I keep a list [here](/about#talks).

Speaking about my craft onstage is nerve-wracking, and a
major time investment if I'm doing it right. But it's worth the
effort, because it benefits me and others. It's fueled my growth as a
developer.

#### The Plan

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Next month I&#39;m speaking at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashrocket">@hashrocket</a> Chicago about <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/vim?src=hash">#vim</a> + <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/reactjs?src=hash">#reactjs</a>!

I'm speaking at [Vim Chicago](https://www.meetup.com/vim-chicago/) next month
about integrating React.js with Vim, and I'd like to use that obligation as an excuse to
write about my speaking preparation process.

In forthcoming posts I plan to cover the steps I take to prepare for a talk, which
are:

1. [Finding an idea](/how-i-talk-finding-an-idea)
1. [Brainstorming](/how-i-talk-brainstorming)
1. [Researching and preparing slides](/how-i-talk-researching-and-preparing-slides)
1. [Practice and Delivery](/how-i-talk-practice-and-delivery)

Some smart people have written on these subjects, and
anything I'd have to say leverages these ideas:

- [Conference Prompts: Or How to Submit Proposals and Influence People](http://www.noelrappin.com/railsrx/2014/1/18/conference-prompts-or-how-to-submit-proposals-and-influence-people)
- [Fix Your Presentations: 21 Quick Tips](http://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/how-to-fix-your-presentations-21-tips.html)
- [Improve Your Presentations In Under $50](http://www.railstips.org/blog/archives/2010/05/05/improve-your-presentations-in-under-50/)
- [Speaking.io](http://speaking.io)
- [What I learned from reading 429 conference proposals](http://www.noelrappin.com/railsrx/2014/3/17/what-i-learned-from-reading-429-conference-proposals)
- [What Your Conference Proposal Is Missing](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2014/04/07/what-your-conference-proposal-is-missing)

Several of these writers talk about submitting conference proposals (AKA
CFPs, or Call-For-Papers). I don't plan to cover that in depth. Why not?
Because I don't really know how it works. I submitted more than a few proposals
before getting accepted to speak at [RailsConf
2017](http://confreaks.tv/videos/railsconf2017-observing-chance-a-gold-master-test-in-practice).
Once you can write a compelling proposal, there is a significant
element of luck to the process. So, submit many proposals, and be like
Thomas Jefferson, who one said: "I'm a great believer in luck, and I find the
harder I work the more I have of it."

I'll link to these posts here as I write them. I can't claim these steps as
essential; they just help me. My target reader is somebody who
wants to speak and has never done so before. I want you to walk away
with encouragement and a step-by-step, jargon-free checklist to
preparing a technical talk. If I can do it, so can you.
