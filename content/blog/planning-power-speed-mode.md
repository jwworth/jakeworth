Today, I published a post on the Hashrocket blog about rapidly assigning points
in a story estimation workflow. It's titled [Planning Poker: Speed
Mode](https://hashrocket.com/blog/posts/planning-poker-speed-mode).

On a recent project, my pair and I developed (or discovered?) this technique.
It helped produce fast, accurate estimations.

Thanks for reading.
