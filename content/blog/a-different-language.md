When people who don't code listen to programmers talk about code, something
they say is that it sounds we're "speaking a different language". We are!
Programming is its own language, and a baffling one to listen to. In this post,
I'll try to explain this phenomenon.

Programming is not a language like JavaScript or Python; those are dialects
that describe a mother tongue called Computer Science. CS is a rag-bag of names
for abstract concepts like classes, functions, and state. Learning to code
means learning many of these names up front.

The names are baffling to listen to because they describe ideas that have
almost no analogy in human life. They are uniquely inhuman, because few things
are less human than a computer. Programming reveals just how differently a
computer approaches a problem than we do. And, each name builds on top of
others like a house of cards. As for the origins of these names, it's
complicated. You can trace some of them back to math, engineering, or skilled
trades. Others come from academic inside jokes, misunderstandings, just
plain old marketing. Some of them seem to come from nowhere.

So yes, programming is a different language. In my talks, I try to build my
arguments from first principles, avoiding jargon when I can. At some
point I'll lose the non-programmers, just like I'd get lost at a medical
conference, but I try to delay that moment as long as I can.
