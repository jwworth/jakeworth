Last week, I published a post on the Hashrocket blog about my favorite
JavaScript package manager, Yarn. It's called [Use Yarn Like a
Pro](https://hashrocket.com/blog/posts/use-yarn-like-a-pro).

These tips are the culmination of two years working with Yarn every day and pairing with
some sharp senior JavaScript developers. I left out a lot of advanced features, and I might
write a follow-up post in the future.

Thanks for reading.
