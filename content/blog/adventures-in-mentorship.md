This fall, I participated in the formal mentorship program at the Code Platoon bootcamp here in Chicago, and I wrote about the experience today for the [Hashrocket Blog](https://hashrocket.com/blog/posts/adventures-in-mentorship).

Mentorship has been incredibly rewarding, and I'm excited to start work with the new cohort this month.

Thanks for reading!
