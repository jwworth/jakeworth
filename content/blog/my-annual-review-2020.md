title: 'My Annual Review 2020'
date: '2020-12-30T00:00:00-06:00'

Each year I conduct a review to reflect on the ending professional year, and
share the results of that review on this blog. Here's the collection going back
to 2015:

- [2019](/my-annual-review-2019/)
- [2018](/my-annual-review-2018/)
- [2017](/my-annual-review-2017/)
- [2016](/my-annual-review-2016/)
- [2015](/my-annual-review-2015/)

This has become a favorite practice for me. The changes seem small day-to-day,
but over a year they add up. Writing this review helps me feel like I'm going
somewhere.

2020 has been a strange year. It hasn't been easy for me to show up every day
this year and write code. And yet I feel privileged to have a job that I love.
Keep showing up and doing your best, everybody, and here's to a better 2021.

### Milestones

This year, I:

- Started building a software product, per my [2019
  goals](/my-annual-review-2019/). Can't share more yet, but I'm psyched!
- Went remote and built a home office. Being remote has brought a
  surprising collection of joys. It helped that our entire industry
  simultaneously went remote due to COVID. Thank you Hashrocket for supporting
  this adventure.
- Consulted for four clients in the legal, PAAS, and retail domains, writing
  Ruby and React.
- Launched two newsletters: [React
  Explained](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/react-explained) and [TIL
  Monthly](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/til/). I learned that writing a
  newsletter is a ton of work, and highly rewarding.
- Signed on as a startup advisor for an entrepreneur in my network.
- Built a Les Paul copy electric guitar from a kit. I did quite a bit of
  soldering, and had many chances to reflect on the similarities between lutherie
  and programming.
- Shipped a COVID-inspired art project, [The
  Bell](https://github.com/jwworth/bell). The purpose of this project was to
  feel connected with other people, build something calming that defied simple
  explanations, and direct visitors to a charity supporting relief efforts. It
  was one of my favorite projects ever.
- Taught SQL to three cohorts of [Code Platoon](https://www.codeplatoon.org/)
  with my friend Jack Christensen, revisiting our perennial theme that
  'databases are important.' Congrats Kilo, Lima, Mike platoons.
- Spoke at Hashrocket MiniConf (Florida and remote) about WebAssembly and
  project management.
- Migrated my note-taking system from
  [LFTM](https://github.com/CoralineAda/lftm) to Bullet Journaling. Bullet
  Journaling won me over because it's a pen-and-paper system, supporting my
  larger goal to limit screen time.
- Mentored two Code Platoon veteran students for an hour a week. Thanks for
  all your hard work, Daniel and Jarrett.

### What did I learn?

- Remote pairing all day is challenging! I believe that pair programming is one
  of the most effective ways to work. It also requires a high EQ, mixing
  engagement and vulnerability. Remote pairing is even tougher because it
  removes body language.
- "Give updates without asks." This is a concept I picked up from my business
  partner. When building relationships in a network, keep people in the loop
  about your progress without asking for something every time. I think this is
  a brilliant way to make networking feel less transactional.
- The value of a great product manager is massive. The blog post [Momentum >
  Urgency](https://testobsessed.com/2020/02/momentum-urgency/) helps define
  this feeling for me. I've known a couple of Drews in my career and each one
  felt irreplaceable.
- I acquired enough design and project management ability to fill those roles,
  when required. Doing some of the [DailyUI](https://www.dailyui.co/) challenge
  pushed me to learn [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/), developing fledgling
  opinions on colors, fonts, layout, and accessibility.
- UI design is a legitimate area of expertise. If you want your application to
  look and feel professional, hire a professional.
- "It's too hard/risky to rename this" is a code and organizational smell. To
  quote Martin Fowler: "Never be afraid to change the names of things to
  improve clarity. With good find and replace tools, it is usually not
  difficult."
- As a senior developer, when arguing that something should be done because
  it's a best practice, you have to understand the _why_ and the tradeoffs.
  Having that information in your back pocket increases your believability, to
  use a Ray Dalio term: how likely it is that the argument you're making is
  correct.
- On #LearnInPublic: you'll only get feedback from a fraction of the people
  that you might be helping and inspiring. That's okay. Keep going. By the same
  token, if you value the content somebody is making, tell them! You'll make
  someone's day, and maybe encourage them to continue.
- "Don't ask for advice, ask for a code review." If you want great career
  opportunities and influence on your team, learn how to write the best code
  you can. There's a lot more to the job, but proficiency in the codebase is
  the fee at the door.
- "Never get off the ladder of learning." This is a quote from a mentor.
  Knowledge is currency in this industry. It must grow with inflation to retain
  value.
- "The best way to get the right answer to a question is to post the wrong
  answer on the internet." I posted [my vimrc on
  Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/k1iv70/my_annotated_vimrc/) and
  stirred up quite a bit of feedback. Apparently nitpicking people's Vim config
  is an r/vim tradition. I certainly got closer to the right answer for me!
- Execution is at least as important as most ideas. To quote Paul Arden: "Do
  not covet your ideas. Give away everything you know and more will come back
  to you."
- Buy the best computer you can; the dollar differences will amortize. I'm
  still working full-time on my 2014 MBP.
- Starting anything requires a few trips back to the drawing board. If the
  first version of every idea was a success, everybody would be an entrepreneur.
- Neglect ergonomics at your peril. The longer you program, the more it
  matters.
- I get as much or more out of mentoring than I put in. I've learned from every
  person I've mentored.
