Programming is a game of abstractions, and we programmers traffic in ideas.
When I find an idea that resonates with me, I turn into an evangelist for it to
everyone who works with me.

Here are some of my favorites. There's a recency bias; I can't remember some of
the formative essays from my early years as a programmer. 

Thanks to [Ben Kuhn](https://www.benkuhn.net/progessays/) for this idea!

### Essays

Jeff Atwood, [The First Rule of Programming: It's Always Your Fault][atwood]. I
like to answer questions on Stack Overflow, and an amazing amount of questions
on that website have a title like "Found a bug in React?" paired with an
introductory sentence: "I'm brand new to React." It's human to assume there's a
problem with your tools or materials. To me, this essay's point is that it's
more profitable to assume the opposite, because your code hasn't stood up to
anything close to the scrutiny of the code from a popular software project.

> If you truly aspire to being a humble programmer, you should have no qualms
about saying "hey, this is my fault-- and I'll get to the bottom of it."
-- Jeff Atwood

Shawn Wang, [Learn in Public][lip]. Be public, leverage the encouragement and
criticism of others, and build a footprint for yourself on the internet. There
are a bunch of detours you can take as a junior developer that waste time and
potentially graduate you to [expert beginner][expert-beginner] status; one of
them is hiding your work in an attempt to avoid criticism. I think one of the
smartest parts of argument this can be summed up in the adage: "The fastest way
to get the right answer to a question is to post the wrong answer on the
internet."

> People think you suck? Good. You agree. Ask them to explain, in detail, why
you suck. You want to just feel good or you want to be good? No objections, no
hurt feelings. Then go away and prove them wrong.
-- Shawn Wang

Elisabeth Hendrickson, [Momentum >
Urgency](https://testobsessed.com/2020/02/momentum-urgency/). I found this post
recently, and it describes the best teams I've worked with. Effective teams
focus on process, not outcome. Managers of such teams know that a team member
being blocked isn't a frustrating detail that that team member will have to
remedy, but rather a process failure that was luckily exposed while many more
remain hidden. They'll use their managerial clout to fight with you against
that obstacle, considering it a top priority.

> What I've learned is that if we want things to go fast, a sense of momentum
is much more effective than a sense of urgency.
-- Elisabeth Hendrickson

Scott Hanselman, [Do they deserve the gift of your
keystrokes?](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/do-they-deserve-the-gift-of-your-keystrokes).
This post isn't just for programmers, but the statistical nature of it
resonated with me. Since reading it, I often consider the reach of my chosen
communication method, and whether I'm making efficient use of time.

> Assuming you want your message to reach as many people as possible, blog it. You only have so many hours in the day.
-- Scott Hanselman

Joel Spolsky, [The Iceberg Secret,
Revealed](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/02/13/the-iceberg-secret-revealed/).
Programmers know that what we can see on a web page can represent a small
fraction or none of the true functionality, completeness, and complexity of the
application. People who don't write software don't automatically know that.
Factor this into all communication.

>  Customers Don’t Know What They Want. Stop Expecting Customers to Know What
They Want. It’s just never going to happen. Get over it.
-- Joel Spolsky

> Understand that any demos you do in a darkened room with a projector are
going to be all about pixels. If you can, build your UI in such a way that
unfinished parts look unfinished.
-- Joel Spolsky

A quote I find relevant, from _It’s Not How Good You Are, It’s How Good You
Want To Be_ by Paul Arden: "The more strikingly visual your presentation is,
the more people will remember it." Every visual detail you add will translate
to a working, MVP feature in the eyes of some stakeholders.

[XY Problem](http://xyproblem.info/). When you're asking for programming help
from someone, start by easing them into your situation, stating the problem,
your assumptions, and what you've tried and learned. Give them the chance to
poke holes in your logic.

> Remember that if your diagnostic theories were accurate, you wouldn't be asking for help right?

Jon Evans, [Why The New Guy Can’t
Code](https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/07/why-the-new-guy-cant-code/). The truth
of this argument has confirmed itself to me over and over again. I think that I
became a programmer on the job. But you can become a programmer right now by
doing just one hard thing: committing to a meaningful project, no matter how
small, and finishing it, in spite of the obstacles you will face.

> So what should a real interview consist of? Let me offer a humble proposal:
don’t interview anyone who hasn't accomplished anything. Ever. Certificates and
degrees are not accomplishments; I mean real-world projects with real-world
users.
-- Jon Evans

But wait! Isn't this a Catch-22? "If no companies hired anybody without
experience, than nobody new could enter the field." I don't agree with this
take on the argument. I've known plenty of self-taught, bootcamp, and CS
students who built an app for themselves, demo day, or their community, family,
or friends, and could clear this bar. They have a resourcefulness and quiet
confidence that leaps out in an interview. To me, that counts as accomplishing
something.

Paul Slaughter, [Conventional comments](https://conventionalcomments.org/). I
believe in code reviews as a technique to raise quality, share information, and
help people grow. But they can go wrong in so many ways and have an almost
opposite effect. This technique– labeling comments to help the recipient
contextualize your feedback– has had a positive impact on several teams I've
been a part of.

> Labeling comments saves hours of undercommunication and misunderstandings.
They are also parseable by machines!
-- Paul Slaughter

David B. Hayes, [Rubber Duck Debugging: The Psychology of How it
Works](https://www.thoughtfulcode.com/rubber-duck-debugging-psychology/).
Trying to understand these ideas, which humans aren't inclined to understand,
has been the most positive influence overall on my debugging skills.

> Because of the psychology of how we humans relate, you’re forced to think
fresh when you invoke your little rubber ducky, and your problem may be quite
simply solved.
-- David B. Hayes

Zed Shaw via Abhishek Nagekar, [Advice From An Old Programmer][zed]. There will
likely come a day when you find programming to be a little bit boring. It will
cease to be joyful as a pure exercise. What do you do then? It's a question I'm
grappling with. I'm choosing to use that skill to build things I care about,
and help others become programmers through volunteering.

> Programming as a profession is only moderately interesting. It can be a good
job, but you could make about the same money and be happier running a fast food
joint. You’re much better off using code as your secret weapon in another
profession.
-- Zed Shaw
