Programming is a game of abstractions, and we programmers traffic in ideas.
When I find an idea that resonates with me, I turn into an evangelist for it to
everyone who works with me.

Here are some of my favorites. There's a recency bias; I can't remember some of
the formative essays from my early years as a programmer. 

Thanks to [Ben Kuhn](https://www.benkuhn.net/progessays/) for this idea!

### Essays

Jeff Atwood, [The First Rule of Programming: It's Always Your Fault][atwood]. I
like to answer questions on Stack Overflow, and an amazing amount of questions
on that website have a title like "Found a bug in React?" paired with an
introductory sentence: "I'm brand new to React." It's human to assume there's a
problem with your tools or materials. To me, this essay's point is that it's
more profitable to assume the opposite, because your code hasn't stood up to
anything close to the scrutiny of the code from a popular software project.

> If you truly aspire to being a humble programmer, you should have no qualms
about saying "hey, this is my fault-- and I'll get to the bottom of it."
-- Jeff Atwood

Shawn Wang, [Learn in Public][lip]. Be public, leverage the encouragement and
criticism of others, and build a footprint for yourself on the internet. There
are a bunch of detours you can take as a junior developer that waste time and
potentially graduate you to [expert beginner][expert-beginner] status; one of
them is hiding your work in an attempt to avoid criticism. I think one of the
smartest parts of argument this can be summed up in the adage: "The fastest way
to get the right answer to a question is to post the wrong answer on the
internet."

> People think you suck? Good. You agree. Ask them to explain, in detail, why
you suck. You want to just feel good or you want to be good? No objections, no
hurt feelings. Then go away and prove them wrong.
-- Shawn Wang

Elisabeth Hendrickson, [Momentum >
Urgency](https://testobsessed.com/2020/02/momentum-urgency/). I found this post
recently, and it describes the best teams I've worked with. Effective teams
focus on process, not outcome. Managers of such teams know that a team member
being blocked isn't a frustrating detail that that team member will have to
remedy, but rather a process failure that was luckily exposed while many more
remain hidden. They'll use their managerial clout to fight with you against
that obstacle, considering it a top priority.

> What I've learned is that if we want things to go fast, a sense of momentum
is much more effective than a sense of urgency.
-- Elisabeth Hendrickson

Scott Hanselman, [Do they deserve the gift of your
keystrokes?](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/do-they-deserve-the-gift-of-your-keystrokes).
This post isn't just for programmers, but the statistical nature of it
resonated with me. Since reading it, I often consider the reach of my chosen
communication method, and whether I'm making efficient use of time.

> Assuming you want your message to reach as many people as possible, blog it. You only have so many hours in the day.
-- Scott Hanselman
