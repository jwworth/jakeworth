Hi there! I'm Jake. ðŸ‘‹

I am an Army veteran, self-taught programmer, and consultant working at
[Hashrocket][hr] in Chicago.

I strive to be reliable, positive, systematic, a great listener and problem
solver. My teammates would describe me as an expert communicator, methodical
and rigorous, but also fun and empathetic in writing and conversation. I'm an
inquisitive person who [learns in public][learn-ip]â€” I level up quickly, and
bring those around me along for the ride.

Check out my [blog][blog] to explore my writing, [now][now] to see what I'm
currently jazzed about, and my projects, talks, and profiles below. I'm most
proud of my volunteer work at [Code Platoon][cp], presenting at RailsConf 2017,
and building [Today I Learned][til], a popular blog that's the number-one
referrer of traffic to my company website.

Thanks for stopping by!

Jake

### Projects

- [Today I Learned][til]: TIL is an [open-source][tilex] project by
  [Hashrocket][hr] that exists to catalogue the sharing and accumulation of
  knowledge as it happens day-to-day. Posts have a 200-word limit, and posting
  is open to any Rocketeer as well as selected friends of Hashrocket. The
  original Rails application was my Hashrocket apprentice project. We
  [open-sourced][oss-til] TIL in early 2016, and today I maintain the project
  with my fellow Rocketeers. Written in Elixir/Phoenix.
- [Game of Life][gol]: My implementation Conway's Game of Life in React.js and
  TypeScript.
- [JavaScript Equality][js-eq]: This application shows the JavaScript
  value-comparison operators `==` and `===` in action. It is written in
  React.js and TypeScript and inspired by the [JavaScript Equality
  Table][js-eq-dorey].
- [Capybara::Webmock][webmock]: A gem that mocks external requests for Capybara
  JavaScript drivers. Written with [Dillon Hafer][dh].
- [Capybara Driver Benchmarking][capybara]: This is the application I built for
  a talk at Hashrocket's Summer Miniconf 2015. Its purpose is to benchmark the
  performance of drivers available for use with Capybara.
- [Ceramic Nation][novel]: A Markov Chain generated novel.
