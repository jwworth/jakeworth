I made a new gem today, called *Remarkovable*.

The source code is here:

https://github.com/jwworth/remarkovable

This gem extracts the Markov chain code I've been using on a bunch of my projects into a single package.

My goal was to have Markov chain code I could plug into any project, that was well-tested and didn't do too much. Features include allowing the user to set a prefix length and custom starting key. So far it's been doing exactly what I needed it to do.

Look for it on Rubygems soon.
