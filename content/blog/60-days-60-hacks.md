For the next 60 days, I'm doing a project to level up in all areas of my craft. I'm calling it '60 Days 60 Hacks'.

Learning is the essence of programming. As developers we are blessed with the challenge of constant learning. Our ideas age the moment they are born.

I want to code as fast as I can think. I want there to be no filter between my mind and the projects I build.

These hacks will encompass every technology I use in my work. The only requirement is that they are new to me, and that they are useful.

I'll be posting them on Twitter ([#60days60hacks](https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=%2360Days60Hacks)) and my learning repository, [TIL](https://github.com/jwworth/til). It will also be content for a platform I am building at work, that I hope to be announcing here soon.

Code on!
