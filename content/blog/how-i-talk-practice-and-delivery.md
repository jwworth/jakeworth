This post is part of a series about preparing technical talks; the introduction
is [here](/how-i-talk).

Today, I'll be covering the final steps of my process: practice and
delivery.

### Practice

In the time I've been writing this series, Gary Bernhardt published an
outstanding blog post, [How to Prepare a
Talk](https://www.deconstructconf.com/blog/how-to-prepare-a-talk). Gary hits
most of the major points I would make. I'd recommend it to any aspiring speaker.

TL;DR, practice is key. I rehearse each section of my talk at least five times, and then run through the entire
talk without stopping another 10-20 times prior to any presentation. I do every rehearsal with a timer, at a podium,
projecting my slides onto something (even just a television screen), wearing
the type of clothing I'll be wearing at the presentation.

I practice setting up my equipment including plugging in the HDMI cable or Airplay,
putting my devices into Airplane mode, setting up live coding, and switching
viewports and display preferences. These mundane tasks can seem impossible 
when standing in front of 300 people.

I practice handling loss of Internet, my presentation software crashing, and
the loss of my actual computer.

I practice staying in a time window by writing timestamps (*T: 10:30*) in the presenter notes of each transition point in the talk.
If I'm ahead of the timestamp, I breathe and drink water. If I'm
behind, I speed up and start policing my ad libs.

Every minute of my talk has been practiced again and again. It's the only
way I know how to present, and it works for me.

### Delivery

If I've been practicing, delivery is an afterthought. When
I'm onstage, I feel unstoppable, despite nerves. There are some
great tips in the aforementioned blog post about eating and
drinking. My best advice is to practice. Practice, so that you can enjoy actual the moment onstage.

Two techniques I avoid: live coding (or technical stunts of any kind) and audience Q & A.
Both of these bring uncertainty (and energy) into a live talk. I
avoid them because I don't feel seasoned enough onstage to control the hairy
situations that can arise when I share control with extra hardware, software,
and other people. I've seen it go wrong many times.

### Conclusion

Thank you for reading this series. I'll conclude with this Tweet from Saron:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Reminder: you don&#39;t have to be amazing to apply. Plenty of mediocre people with impressively high self confidence win everyday because they applied and you didn&#39;t. Throw your hat in the ring.</p>&mdash; Saron (@saronyitbarek) <a href="https://twitter.com/saronyitbarek/status/969737202216271872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 3, 2018</a></blockquote>

Public speaking isn't magic. It's a skill anybody can get better at. The
personal and professional benefits I've accrued have been worth every moment of
self-doubt and nervousness. Give it a try, and let me know how you do.
