I'm writing a blog post series about preparing technical talks, here are the five parts:

1. [How I Talk](/how-i-talk)
1. [Finding an idea](/how-i-talk-finding-an-idea)
1. [Brainstorming](/how-i-talk-brainstorming)
1. [Researching and preparing slides](/how-i-talk-researching-and-preparing-slides)
1. [Practice and Delivery](/how-i-talk-practice-and-delivery)

Today, I'll be covering the final steps of my process: practice and
delivery.

### Practice

In the time I've been writing this series, Gary Bernhardt published an
outstanding blog post, [How to Prepare a
Talk](https://www.deconstructconf.com/blog/how-to-prepare-a-talk). Gary hits
most of the major points I would make. I'd recommend it.

Practice is everything. I rehearse each section of my talk at least five times,
and then run through the entire talk without stopping another 10-20 times prior
to any presentation. I do every rehearsal with a timer, at a podium, projecting
my slides onto something (even just a television screen), even wearing the type
of clothing I'll be wearing at the presentation.

I practice setting up my equipment, including plugging in the HDMI cable or
Airplay, putting my devices into Airplane/Do Not Disturb/silent mode, setting
up live coding, and switching display preferences. These little things can be
hard to do smoothly when standing in front of 300 people.

I practice handling loss of Internet, my presentation software crashing, and
even losing my computer.

I practice staying in a time window by writing timestamps like *T: 10:30* in
the presenter notes of each transition point in the talk. If I'm ahead of the
timestamp, which is usually the case, I breathe and drink water. If I'm behind,
I speed up.

If you get a chance, deliver the talk once to a real audience. For a Meetup
talk, deliver it first to your coworkers or friends. For a conference talk,
deliver it once at a Meetup. Leave time for Q & A in the practice run; the
questions your audience asks are very valuable. Answer them preemptively on
the next run, or add a section addressing common counterarguments or edge
cases. The end result will be a tighter, stronger argument.

### Delivery

If I've been practicing, delivery is an afterthought. Knowing that I've put on
the time makes me feel unstoppable. My only advice is to practice. Practice, so
that you can enjoy the moment.

Two techniques I avoid: live coding or technical stunts of any kind, and
audience Q & A in the final performance. Both of these bring uncertainty into a
live talk. I avoid them because I've seen it go wrong many times.

### Conclusion

Thank you for reading this series. I'll conclude with this Tweet from Saron:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Reminder: you don&#39;t have to be amazing to apply. Plenty of mediocre people with impressively high self confidence win everyday because they applied and you didn&#39;t. Throw your hat in the ring.</p>&mdash; Saron (@saronyitbarek) <a href="https://twitter.com/saronyitbarek/status/969737202216271872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 3, 2018</a></blockquote>

Public speaking isn't magic. It's a skill anybody can get better at. The
personal and professional benefits I've accrued have been worth every moment of
self-doubt and nervousness. Give it a try, and let me know how you do.
