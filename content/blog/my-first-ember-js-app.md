The last two weeks I've been diving into JavaScript frameworks, culminating in my first Ember.js app.

I built it with Vic Ramon's Ember Tutorial (<a href='http://ember.vicramon.com'>http://ember.vicramon.com</a>). Vic's tutorial is outstanding. He breaks down the internals of an Ember project with a focus on quickly building a working prototype.  I highly recommend it.

Here is the stack:

* Rails 4.2 and Ruby 2.2.0
* CoffeeScript
* Ember-Rails
* Postgres 9.4
* Ember-Data for frontend-backend communication
* Emblem.js for tidy views
* Puma development web server
* Ffaker for database population
* Heroku hosting

I also used <a href='https://github.com/tpope/vim-projectionist'>Vim Projectionist</a> for the first time on this project. This is a Tim Pope vim plugin that lets you create custom shortcuts for your JavaScript project files. I used it to rapidly navigate and generate boilerplate.

Another resource I leveraged was 5by5's 'Ruby on Rails Podcast #179 with Trek Glowacki - Learning Ember' (<a href='http://5by5.tv/rubyonrails/179'>http://5by5.tv/rubyonrails/179</a>). Trek is an Ember core team member and shares the past, present, and future of Ember, as well as some anecdotes about his career as a code-documenter and passionate early adopter. I enjoyed it.

If you're interested in JavaScript frameworks, check out Ember. Ember artfully mixes the ease of Rails' convention over configuration with the front-end shine of JavaScript. Love or hate them, JavaScript web apps are not going away. It's a great time to learn Ember, because the platform is maturing, the core team seems forward-thinking, and better tutorials and documentation appear every day.

Thank you to Vic Ramon, Tim Pope, 5by5, Trek Glowacki, all the open source teams and service providers listed in the stack above, and everyone I paired and talked with these past two weeks.
