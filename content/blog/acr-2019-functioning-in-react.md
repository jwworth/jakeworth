This October I'll be presenting a talk titled _Functioning in React: A
Deep-Dive into useState_ at [Ancient City
Ruby](https://www.ancientcityruby.com/) in Jax Beach, FL. Here's the abstract:

> The State Hook is now a core part of React. But what does it mean for a
> function to have state? This talk explores this question, touching on the
> history of state, the source code behind the hook, and the impact stateful
> functions have on the code we write.

This is a focused examination of the `useState` hook, a feature I have been
pondering for almost a year. Hooks are a trendy subject, so it's a noisy space,
but I haven't yet seen a talk that's trying to approach the subject from this
angle.
