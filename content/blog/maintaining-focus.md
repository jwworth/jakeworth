I think *the* hardest thing about being a developer is maintaining focus.

I am as guilty of distraction, FOMO, and indecisiveness as anybody. It's a
plague in our industry. It leads to weeks like this, where I have spend a
half-day building a Rust koan library, a half-day reading an e-book about Rust,
and fifteen minutes doing a Swift tutorial.

No more!

Here is a list of where I want to devote my open-source time for the rest of
June. I hope by posting it here, I will be pressured into staying on track:

1. Finish [this tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/learn/v4/overview)
   and ship something (anything) with it. Bonus points for a project that is
   cool and/or useful.
2. Build something basic with React Native.
3. Find an undocumented public method in Rust, document it, and get it merged
   into the project.

These goals are designed to help me stay on track with my [New Year's
goals](http://www.jakeworth.com/my-annual-review-2015), while also supporting
#60days60contributions, which is about halfway done.

Let's see how I do!
