Over the past month I completely overhauled [Scrapp](https://github.com/jwworth/scrapp).

I wrote Scrapp on a train to Champaign-Urbana, as a demo of my skills as a junior developer.

Back then I was just beginning to learn Rails 4, TDD, Vim, design patterns, and the tools of the Rubyist's trade. I styled it with Bootstrap, because I thought that would look better than anything I could do.

Over the past year I have learned a lot, and I poured it all into this overhaul. The new Scrapp has less features than the original, but those features are cleaner and more robust.

A few of my favorite changes:

* Upgraded from Rails 4.1 to 4.2
* Entire app is tested (60% test coverage to 98% test coverage)
* Restyled without Bootstrap (Google fonts page header, new color palette, added favicon, all text sans serif)
* Made better factories
* Rebranded site name and subheader
* Removed tons of Rails boilerplate
* Added HTTP basic auth for staging environments

Stay tuned for next year, when I do this all over again.
