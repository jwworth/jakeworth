I'm now five weeks into my learning project [#60days60hacks](https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=%2360Days60Hacks).

I've been documenting this all on [Today I Learned](http://til.hashrocket.com), a project I built with my team at Hashrocket. We recently hit 100 posts on that site, and every day Rocketeers in Jacksonville and Chicago are producing great content there. I encourage you to check it out.

This week I learned:

* How to rebase with execution
* How to cast an array as a sentence in Rails
* How to rename a git branch locally and on Github (without breaking everything)
* How to clear a git stash
* How to execute callbacks conditionally
* How to cast a `TimeWithZone` as a date in SQL
* How to source dive a bundled gem
* How to rename a tmux window a lot of different ways

It's been fun to challenge my grasp of the tools I use every day. I've been writing a lot of JavaScript lately and I'd like to incorporate that into next week's posts. JavaScript was the first language I experimented with, and I am continually reminded of what a powerful language it is. Mastery of JavaScript is imperative for an expert developer, and so I plan to write a lot more of it in the coming weeks.
