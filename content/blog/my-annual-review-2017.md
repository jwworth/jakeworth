Each year I conduct an annual review to help me reflect on the ending year.
Here's a [link](/my-annual-review-2016) to last year's.

### What Went Well

I learned a lot this year.

Headline: we rewrote [Today I Learned](https://til.hashrocket.com), a Rails
app, in Elixir/Phoenix. Here's the
[announcement](https://hashrocket.com/blog/posts/today-i-learned-in-phoenix).
This was my passion project and would not have happened without these
committers: Chris Erin, Dorian Karter, Josh Branchaud, and Taylor Mock. We even
got a
[commit](https://github.com/hashrocket/tilex/commit/49d726e1ce50e309c6a6f6a6256fd0601e9566c1)
from Elixir creator JosÃ© Valim; that was cool! I wrote a ton of newbie Elixir
code in this project, so please, open source folks, [have at
it](https://github.com/hashrocket/tilex).

My favorite blog post was [Format Your Elixir Code
Now](https://hashrocket.com/blog/posts/format-your-elixir-code-now), and I'll
be speaking about it in January at [Chicago
Elixir](https://www.meetup.com/ChicagoElixir/events/244583193/).

I wrote a lot of React and Redux this year, and my competency with these tools
exploded, thanks to reading this
[cartoon](https://code-cartoons.com/a-cartoon-intro-to-redux-3afb775501a6)
about ten times and embracing the beautiful nightmare that is JavaScript. I
loved this work.

Another exciting experience was teaching at [Code
Platoon](https://www.codeplatoon.org/) with my friend Jack Christensen.
[Here](https://hashrocket.com/blog/posts/hashrocket-and-code-platoon) I explained this unique partnership.

Another milestone was speaking at RailsConf 2017. Here's my
[summary](https://hashrocket.com/blog/posts/observing-change-a-gold-master-test-in-practice)
of that experience, including the video. I was honored to speak twelve other
times, including at [React Chicago](meetup.com/react-chicago).

Our [Vim Chicago](https://www.meetup.com/vim-chicago/) community hosted ten
Meetups and reached 400 members, double our size from two years ago. I loved
partnering with
[ChicaGoLang](https://www.meetup.com/Vim-Chicago/events/236215630/),
[CJUG](https://www.meetup.com/Vim-Chicago/events/239299991/), and hosting the
inimitable [Andy Lester](https://www.meetup.com/Vim-Chicago/events/237180162/).

### Last Year's Goals

From last year's review:

> [My major professional goal is to] submit twelve CFP proposals to technical
> conferences in 2017.

In the end I submitted eleven CFPs. Waiting until December for my final
submission was a bad strategy, because I couldn't find any conferences
accepting CFPs this month that matched my interests.

### Next Year's Goals

My main professional goal for 2018 is to submit 10 CFPs.

Why this focus again? This tweet from Charity Majors echos my feelings:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The biggest boost for my career the past five years wasn&#39;t working at Facebook or being a manager, it was developing public speaking skills.</p>&mdash; Charity Majors (@mipsytipsy) <a href="https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy/status/912103246017294336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Submitting CFPs had many incredible side effects. In the process of
workshopping ideas, I prepared a group of small talks for Meetups, and learned
a [lot](/how-i-talk). It forced me to stick with ideas for a long time,
synthesize, and practice commanding a room. And it led to an unforgettable
opportunity at RailsConf. Most importantly, it made me a better developer in
ways I'm still discovering.

Why ten? They say one in ten CFPs is selected. This year I submitted eleven
CFPs; one was selected. I'm an average submitter. I'm not Sandi Metz. But I
could be Stephen King, who submitted dozens of manuscripts before his first
publication and went on to an illustrious career. If I want another shot, I'll
need to submit at least another ten CFPs.
