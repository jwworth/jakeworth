I'm happy to announce that in January 2020, I'll be giving my first
presentation about [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) to my colleagues at
Hashrocket, in a talk titled *WebAssembly 101*.

This is talk-driven-development-- I'm speaking about WebAssembly
because I know very little about it and want to learn. I believe it's an
important emerging technology that may greatly affect web developers. I hope
the talk helps bootstrap my coworkers and push our technical discussion in a
new direction.

Hashrocket Miniconfs aren't recorded or made public, so I won't be sharing any
video or slides. However, I'll be writing about what I learn on Twitter at
[@jwworth](https://twitter.com/jwworth). Follow me there to join on the
journey. I hope some of those learnings spill over into this blog; if that
happens I'll update this post with links.
