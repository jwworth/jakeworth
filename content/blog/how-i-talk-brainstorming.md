I'm writing a blog post series about preparing technical talks; the
introduction is available [here](/how-i-talk).

Today, I'll be covering the second part of my process: brainstorming.

Brainstorming is the most important part of the process. It's the foundation for everything
that follows, and it has two parts:

1. Thinking deeply in a subject on a completely open-minded way, paying attention to ideas that cross
my mind, ideas in the world, and relevant ideas of my colleagues and friends.
1. Recording *everything*.

Here's a little more about each step.

### Thinking

To prepare a good talk, I need to generate a lot of ideas.

Stephen King's *On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft* contains a useful anecdote. As a young writer, King
faced rejection after rejection. After much failure, one editor took the
time to offer some advice, writing on his manuscript something like "Get rid of
10%". King removed 10% of the words from his manuscript, began submitting it
again, and soon landed his first publication deal. Cutting 10% (sometimes again
and again) became one of his most valuable tools.

In other words, "kill your darlings".

For every idea that makes it into a talk, I've rejected four or five.  This
ratio is possible because I think deeply in a subject in an open-minded and
non-trivial way. Listening to technical news and blog posts, reading code,
listening to the people around me, and non-judgementally writing things down.
With this mindset, I can cultivate a long list of ideas which will help me fill
out the time and hopefully keep the audience engaged.

Leading up to a talk, I like to solicit ideas from my coworkers and the general
programming. I had some great conversations and received many ideas through our
company Slack. Borrowing ideas from others makes your talk stronger
against the inevitable blind spots we all possess.

Here is my current brainstorm list for my talk next month. I check off an idea
when I've researched it, regardless of whether or not it survives and makes it 
into the final presentation.

### Reactjs + Vim Talk Ideas

- [x] Build the talk from a blank virtual box
- [ ] Writing JS in Vim – Alex LaFroscia – Medium
- [ ] Investigate `.eshintrc` settings
- [ ] Go top to bottom through a JSX file and find optimizations
- [ ] Vim nnoremap: `\p — :! prettier %`
- [ ] Technologist often arrive at the same idea independently (PrettierJS)
- [ ] Linting solves needless churn and technical debating
- [ ] Ale plugin
- [ ] CLTab
- [ ] `CTRL X + CTRL L` - tab complete import statements
- [ ] Vim-surround plugin for JSX
- [ ] Who even use Vim?
- [ ] What is Vim?
- [ ] vim-react-snippets
- [ ] https://github.com/epilande/vim-react-snippets
- [ ] https://github.com/epilande/vim-es2015-snippets
- [ ] match-tag-always (vim plugin)
- [ ] Vim-projectionist projections
- [ ] Neoformat with javascript
- [ ] Neoformat fixes code
- [ ] Neoformat tells you when it’s poorly formatted
- [ ] Neoformat easier PRs to review, less churn
- [ ] Neoformat - Don’t save early
- [ ] Look at office vimrc.local's for inspiration
```

Not all these ideas are good. But they will give me a lot of potential paths to take.

### Record Everything

I use [GTD](http://gettingthingsdone.com/) for taking notes in a physical
notebook. Whatever your method, be sure to capture every one of the great ideas
you generate. Without a rigorous system of note-taking, I would lose a lot of
the ideas to simple forgetfulness.

### Conclusion

Thinking deeply about a subject, while also being a sponge to the world,
combined with an effective system of note-taking, is how I get from an idea to
the first draft of my talks.

The next post in this series covers an important subject, researching and preparing slides.
