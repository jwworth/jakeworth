Today I am pleased to share my first post in the Semaphore community, available
[here](https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/integration-testing-phoenix-with-wallaby).

This is a republication of a post from the Hashrocket blog about integration
testing Phoenix with Wallaby.

Learning to test-drive Elixir code while building the [Phoenix
port](https://github.com/hashrocket/tilex) of 'Today I Learned' has been very
exciting, and this posts reflects that excitement. It's one of the blog posts I
worked on the longest; truly a labor of love.

Thank you to Semaphore for reading my post and reaching out. I hope to continue
contributing to the community as time goes on.
