Today I am pleased to share my first post in the Semaphore community, available [here](https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/integration-testing-phoenix-with-wallaby).

This is a republication of a post from the Hashrocket blog about integration testing Phoenix with Wallaby.

Learning to test-drive Elixir code while building the [Phoenix port](https://github.com/hashrocket/tilex) of 'Today I Learned' has been very exciting, and this posts reflects that excitement. It's one of the blog posts I worked on the longest; truly a labor of love.

Thank you to Semaphore for reading my post and reaching out. I hope to continue contributing to the community as time goes on. 
Also, here's the banner art Semaphore created for the post, which I like a lot:
