A coworker recently taught me a client management technique that I love ❤️.

When a stakeholder asks for a change to the software we're developing, my
standard response is, roughly: "Sure thing".

Then later: "I'm working on that issue we discussed now".

And finally: "It's done".

Here's an alternate approach. Skip the first two conversations and go straight
to the third. So, if I receive a message asking for a change, I do it as soon as
I can, and my first and only response to the client is: "It's done".

It's a variation on the adage "Underpromise; overdeliver". In this case, my silence
promises nothing, the most under- of underpromises. And I deliver in a moment
when stakeholders have pushed the problem out of their minds. That is more than
they expect.

A literary touchstone is [A Message to Garcia][message], a short story by
Elbert Hubbard. Hubbard tells the tale of Lieutenant Andrew Rowan, who was
tasked to deliver a secret message to General Calixto García in Cuba just prior
to the Spanish–American War. Instead of engaging in a conversation
about how he might accomplish this herculean task, he disappears and
single-handedly gets it done. Writing software might have lower stakes, but this
method of concise communication still inspires me.

Hubbard writes:

> It is not book-learning young men need, nor instruction about this or that,
> but a stiffening of the vertebrae which will cause them to be loyal to a
> trust, to act promptly, concentrate their energies; do the thing - "carry a
> message to Garcia!"

If you can, skip the conversation and just do it.

A caveat: this technique only works when your team is asynchronous, and your
stakeholders are patient. You have to get back to them in a timely manner;
minutes or hours not days. A certain breed of micromanagement will never accept
the delay. But more folks than you might think can be persuaded to appreciate the
tradeoff. Especially if what they hear most often is "it's done".

This technique creates a shorter interaction with less back-and-forth. And it
establishes you as the type of programmer who gets things done.
