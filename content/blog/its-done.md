title: It's Done

A coworker recently taught me a client management technique that I love.

When a stakeholder asks for a change to the software we're developing, my
default response is, roughly: "Sure thing". 

Then later: "I'm working on that issue we discussed now". 

And finally: "It's done".

Here's an alternate approach: skip the first two conversations and go straight
to the third. So, if I receive an email asking for a change, I do it as soon as
I can, and my first and only communication to the client is: "It's done".

It's a play on the adage "Underpromise; overdeliver". In this case, I'm not
promising anything, the most under- of promises. And I deliver in a moment when
stakeholders have pushed the problem completely out of their minds. That is
more than they expect.

This technique demands asynchronous and patient communication between team
members. It creates a shorter interaction with less back-and-forth. And it
establishes you as the type of programmer who gets things done.
