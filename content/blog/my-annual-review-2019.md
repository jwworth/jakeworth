Every year I conduct an annual review to reflect on the ending professional
year. Here are my notes from this year's review.

### Milestones

Here are my milestones from 2019. This year, I:

- [Ported my blog](/gatsby-port) from Rails to Gatsby.js. I am ecstatic about
  this change. Writing React and markdown, and deploying with GitHub, makes for
  an effortless workflow. I also [open sourced](/open-source-again) the
  codebase ([source code](https://github.com/jwworth/jakeworth)). I'd love some
  PR's or issues on the repo.
- Received a [challenge coin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge_coin)
  from [Code Platoon](https://codeplatoon.org/) for work as a volunteer. Thank
  you Rod! I love being a part of this community.
- Created and administered, along with my colleague Suzanne, an internal Developer's
  Survey for Hashrocket. We presented our findings (everybody really loves
  React and TypeScript) at Hashrocket's Summer MiniConf.
- Tried out working 100% remotely. I enjoyed the experience. Along the way, I
  learned the value of a good coworking space.
- Doubled my [Stack
  Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2112512/jake-worth) reputation
  (1,511 points this year, top 3% of the site for 2019). There are a lot of
  people out there who need help with their code, and I'm happy to give back.
  I'm coming for you, [Jon
  Skeet](https://stackoverflow.com/users/22656/jon-skeet)!
- Spoke at Ancient City Ruby 2019 about React.js. My preparation included some
  of the most challenging source diving I've ever done. My slides are
  [here](https://speakerdeck.com/jwworth/functioning-in-react-a-deep-dive-into-usestate);
  video forthcoming I hope. I'm averaging one conference presentation a year,
  which feels right. Thanks for the opportunity to share, ACR.
- Mentored four Code Platoon veterans. Proud to have been a part of your
  journey, Ben, Kyle, Christian, and Hal. Good luck out there.
- Taught SQL three times at Code Platoon with my friend Jack Christensen.
- Got paid by a client to write Elixir code for the first time.
- Attended my first RubyConf with coworkers and friends old and new. Spent some
  one-on-one time with my programming idols.

### What did I learn?

Here are some some of my takeaways after another year in the programming
trenches. Some of these lessons were from 2019, others were lessons I've
learned in the past and reflected on again this year.

- [How to do faster planning](https://hashrocket.com/blog/posts/planning-poker-speed-mode)
- [How to pick a good name](https://hashrocket.com/blog/posts/pick-a-good-name)
- [How to make social media images with ImageMagick](https://hashrocket.com/blog/posts/generate-images-for-instagram)
- I'm highly motivated to build and ship an application of my own. At some
  point, a lot of programmers want to take the skills they've learned and build
  something personal and audacious, and 2019 was the year I crossed that
  threshold. Consulting provides me with the time and inspiration to make such
  an investment. Watch this space.
- It's better to be working with difficult technology, than a difficult team.
  Applies to many disciplines, including programming.
- Elixir is a fantastic language to work on professionally. Also, an
  application written in any language, even a basically perfect language like
  Elixir, can have its edges.
- Reading technical books consistently requires small, sustained effort every
  day.
- If I drink coffee after noon, I don't fall asleep. ☕️

### Thank You

Thanks to my family and friends, everyone at Hashrocket, and my clients for another
wonderful years as a programmer. And thank you for reading.

Happy New Year everyone.
