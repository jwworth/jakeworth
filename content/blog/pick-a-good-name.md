Last week, I published a post on the Hashrocket blog about choosing good names
for things in software. It's called [Pick a Good
Name](https://hashrocket.com/blog/posts/pick-a-good-name).

Naming is tough, but I think with the considerations I outlined in the post,
we can get it right most of the time.

Thanks for reading.
