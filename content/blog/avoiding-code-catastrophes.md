Last week, I published a Hashrocket blog post for junior developers, addressing a question I've been asked a few times. It's called 'Avoiding Code Catastrophes', and you can read it [here](https://hashrocket.com/blog/posts/avoiding-code-catastrophes).

My argument is that the type of career-ending disasters new programmers fear don't happen on an effective engineering team. When they do happen, the process has failed, not the junior developer.

Please enjoy.
