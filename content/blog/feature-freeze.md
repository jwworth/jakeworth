title: 'Feature Freeze'

As of today, I'm putting a one-year pause on any development of this blog
platform. It's a feature freeze that will extend until the end of 2021. I'm
only allowed to publish content, update written copy on my [Now](/now) and
[About](/about) pages, and upgrade critical dependencies.

I love maintaining my own blog platform. I can endlessly tweak each piece of
HTML, incorporate practices I learn at work, develop practices for work. It's
fun, and if I'm being honest, it's also procrastination.

This year, I have different goals that will require me to focus, including
shipping 52 issues of [React
Explained](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/react-explained) and launching a
side project I've been thinking about for some time. I won't accomplish either
of these things if I'm pushing bits on the platform.
