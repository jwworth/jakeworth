It's been a month since I replaced all the keys on my keyboard with blank keys.

Here's a picture of my current rig:

Ok, I kept four of the original keys, which spell my name. This is a WASD mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX Clear switches, which feel great and sound loud.

#### Observations

Typing on a blank keyboard is tough. It is a lot harder than I thought it would be. I was under the impression that I never looked at the keys; this proved to be false. I actually look at the keys a lot. Taking that away has been illuminating.

There's a psychological factor at play, too. I've discovered that having blank keys makes me a worse typist, and I think it's mental. I am expecting to not find the keys I need, on a subconscious level, and as a result make more mistakes. It's a strange self-reinforcing error.

The toughest keys to do without? Numbers and symbols. As a Vim user I rely on plugin behavior like `cs'"` (change 'foo' to "foo", via Vim.surround) and basic Vim composition like `2dd` (delete two lines), and these are a lot tougher without printed keys. As a Rubyist I type a lot of instance variables like `@post` and interpolated strings like `"#{post.body}"`, and these are also harder to execute.

Keeping printed keys on my laptop, where I do at least 50% of my programming, is a crutch. But switching out a Macbook's keys is a surgery-like process I don't intend to embark on anytime soon. I recognize that this is an obstacle. There is certainly friction in the daily switching back-and-forth.

#### Future Plans

I'm planning to stick with the blank keyboard for now.

Despite years at the keyboard, I've never been the most accurate typist, hovering around 80-90% even on basic English passages. As I result, I don't think I'm paying a huge penalty in accuracy now; possibly I'm exposing inaccuracies that have been there all along. That's a solid reason to keep going.

Even with the mistakes, I believe that this endeavor is making me a faster and more reflexive programmer. It's an investment in my craft, much like learning Vim. I believe that the discomfort will be temporary. The payoff will be that I can program faster, with less mental overhead, rapidly dictating conference notes or hacking through the Clojure koans. Mr. Miyagi caught those flies with his chopsticks while *blindfolded*, if memory serves.

My pairs have been gracious in this pursuit. We are a nerdy bunch and suspect that they understand my goal.

Also, the keyboard just looks cool. It's my keyboard, and I'm proud of it, like a knight of old. It stands as a daunting challenge to anybody who might try to type on it, including me. Those who can are worthy of some serious respect.
