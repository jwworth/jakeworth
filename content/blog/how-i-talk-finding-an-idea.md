I'm writing a blog post series about preparing technical talks, here are the five parts:

1. [How I Talk](/how-i-talk)
1. [Finding an idea](/how-i-talk-finding-an-idea)
1. [Brainstorming](/how-i-talk-brainstorming)
1. [Researching and preparing slides](/how-i-talk-researching-and-preparing-slides)
1. [Practice and Delivery](/how-i-talk-practice-and-delivery)

Today, I'll be covering the first part of my process, finding an idea.

Here's a great primer on why you, reader, have valuable ideas:

- [Conference Prompts: Or How to Submit Proposals and Influence People](http://www.noelrappin.com/railsrx/2014/1/18/conference-prompts-or-how-to-submit-proposals-and-influence-people)

What ideas lead to great talks? My strongest talks share the following traits:

1. I'm passionate about the idea
1. I know the subject well enough to master it in the allotted time
1. I've practiced the subject in the recent past

To lend context, I'll take a case study from the talk I'm preparing for next
month's [Vim Chicago](https://www.meetup.com/Vim-Chicago/events/242379732/) and
[React Chicago](https://www.meetup.com/React-Chicago/events/238418830/)
Meetups, *React.js + Vim*.

### Passion

I love Vim. Learning this 25-year-old text editor changed my career. I went
[all-in](/vim-or-bust) on Vim three years ago and have translated my passion
into organizing the [Vim Chicago Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Vim-Chicago/).
And, I also love React. React is my tool of choice for the frontend.

Like any technical ability, writing React code well in Vim exists on a spectrum
ranging from barely-getting-it-done to ninja flow state.

It takes work to build your Vim into the perfect React development
environment. Writing React code means that I seek that perfection. What
mappings, plugins, and workflow hacks can I use to get there?  It's a subject
that I care about, and that's the most important trait of a good talk.

### Familiarity

An idea that's explored in [Speaking.io](http://speaking.io) is that
aspirational talks, i.e.– "I want to know about this subject, so I'll sign up
for a talk and learn it by the deadline"– can backfire.  I've heard this idea
referred to as Talk Driven Development, and if it works for you, great.

I have to start with a base of understanding. I need to already be at least at
the same level of the average listener. Only then do I have a chance at pushing
myself and my listeners beyond that level into unfamiliar ground.

### Freshness

For passion to translate to an interesting talk, I need to have done the work
recently. When somebody is speaking about an idea that's fresh in their mind,
the talk is better.

The ideas also have to be relevant to a developer working in the world right
now. In the case of *React.js + Vim*, the JavaScript ecosystem is constantly
changing, and any techniques I haven't validated recently will likely be
outdated.

Another benefit of talking about recent completed work is that I've had
time to recognize the things I could have done better. I can integrate these
lessons into the talk.

### Conclusion

Talks are entertainment, and with the right passion, familiarity, and
freshness, I hope to produce something worth listening to.

The next post in this series covers an important subject, brainstorming.
