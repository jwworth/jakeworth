title: 'How I Talk: Finding An Idea'

I'm writing a blog post series about preparing technical talks; the
introduction is available [here](/how-i-talk).

Today, I'll be covering the first part of my process: finding an idea.

Here's a great primer on why you have ideas worth listening to:

- [Conference Prompts: Or How to Submit Proposals and Influence People](http://www.noelrappin.com/railsrx/2014/1/18/conference-prompts-or-how-to-submit-proposals-and-influence-people)

Let's move into the tough question: what ideas lead to great talks? My strongest talks share the following traits:

1. I'm passionate about the idea
1. I know the subject well (and can master it in the allotted time)
1. I've practiced the subject professionally in the recent past

To lend context, I'll take a case study from the talk I'm preparing for next month's [Vim
Chicago](https://www.meetup.com/Vim-Chicago/events/242379732/) and
[React Chicago](https://www.meetup.com/React-Chicago/events/238418830/) Meetups,
*React.js + Vim*.

### Passion

I love Vim; learning this 25-year-old text editor changed my career. I went
[all-in](/vim-or-bust) on Vim three years ago and have translated my passion
into organizing the [Vim Chicago Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Vim-Chicago/).
And, I also love React.js. React is my tool of choice for the frontend.

Like any language or framework, creating React.js code in Vim has layers of efficiency
ranging from barely-getting-it-done to flow state.

It takes work to build your Vim into the perfect React.js development
environment. Writing React.js code professionally means that I
seek that perfection. What mappings, plugins, and workflow hacks can I use to
get there? It's a subject that I care about, and that's is the most important
trait of a good talk.

### Familiarity

An idea that's explored in [Speaking.io](http://speaking.io) is that
aspirational talks, i.e.– "I want to know about this subject, so I'll sign up
for a talk and learn it by the deadline"– can backfire.  I've heard this idea
humorously referred to as Talk Driven Development, and if it works for you,
great.

I have to start with a solid base of understanding. I need to already be at least at the same level of the average listener. Only then do I have a chance at pushing myself and that listner beyond that
level into unfamiliar ground. 

### Freshness

For passion to translate to an interesting talk, I need to have done the
work recently. You can tell when somebody is speaking about an idea that's fresh in 
their mind.

The ideas also have to be relevant to a developer working in the world
right now. In the case of *React.js + Vim*, the JavaScript ecosystem is
constantly changing, and any techniques I haven't validated or re-validated recently will likely be obsolete.

Another benefit of talking about recent completed work is that I've
usually had time to recognize the things I could have done better. With perspective, I can integrate these lessons into the talk.

### Conclusion

Talks are entertainment, and with
the right passion, familiarity, and freshness, I hope to produce something worth
listening to.

The next post in this series covers an important subject, brainstorming.
