A self-teaching, learning programmer asked me the following question:

> Can you recommend any resources or sites that you go to with questions, or to
keep up with the latest info?

I think this is a tough question. There is a glut of programming information
online. You can't read it all, and you shouldn't, because much of it is
outdated, wrong, or irrelevant to you.

So, what is the signal in this noise? I recommend aggregators, blogs, pair
programming. And I offer a gentle recommendation against  tutorials.

### Aggregators

I've summarized this idea before in a Hashrocket blog post called 'How to
Prepare for a Technical Interview':

> I advocate a passive approach: whatever watercooler you frequent (Twitter,
Medium, RSS, Reddit, email mailing lists, etc.), find the aggregators. These
are people who read everything-- blog posts, release notes, conference
announcements, Twitter fights-- and distill it down into a human-sized product.
I subscribe to weekly email newsletters for React, JavaScript, Ruby, and
Postgres. Each week, I scan the headlines and one or two articles. You build up
a picture of the scene pretty quickly.

I have found this technique highly efficient, so much that I launched two of my
own newsletters in 2020, [React
Explained](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/react-explained) and [TIL
Monthly](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/til/).

### Blogs

I love technical blogs. Lots of great programmers have them. Incidentally, I
[recommend blogging](/you-should-blog/). As a blog reader, find a programmer
you respect, find their blog if they have one, and read every article. It's a
dramatic shortcut into their mode of thinking. I'm currently speeding
through [Ben Kuhn's](https://www.benkuhn.net/) writing, and I did the same
thing earlier this year with Basecamp's Signal v. Noise.

Here are few of my [favorite
posts](/essays-on-programming-i-think-about-a-lot/) to get you started.

### Pair Programming

The best resource of all is pair programming. You'll learn more pairing for an
hour with a smart, empathetic senior developer than you will in a month reading
tutorials. Stay on the lookout for pairing opportunities, seek them out, and
jump on them when they arrive.

Second-best resource is a code review. Ship a small thing and post it on
Reddit or Stack Overflow. The feedback is going to be brutal, but if you can
face the comments section and consider the ideas there, you'll get better. An
unattributed quote I love: "Don't ask for advice, ask for a code review."

### Avoid Tutorials &#9940;

One of the best and toughest pieces of advice I'd give to someone learning to
code: wean yourself off tutorials as soon as you can, in favor of building
stuff. This [blog
post](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/become-a-standout-developer-and-accelerate-your-coding-skills/)
from Randall Kanna makes this case here pretty well, under the header 'Escape
Tutorial Hell.'

I never read tutorials with exception of the official 'Get Started' guides on
popular open-source projects. Why? I will learn faster and more deeply on my
own. I prefer to build my own mental models instead of trying to download
someone else's. And I expect that some parts of the tutorial will be
outdated, leading me toward a momentum-crushing series of side quests.

If you're pondering starting a tutorial, ask yourself: how did the person who
created this content learn enough to teach it? They figured it out, trying
stuff, reading official docs, searching online, and thinking deeply about their
problem. Getting stuck and then getting unstuck is how you get better, and
tutorials rob you of that opportunity.

### Conclusion

Want to stay relevant? I recommend aggregators, blogs, and pair programming.
I'd love to hear about the resources you value via [Twitter][twitter].
