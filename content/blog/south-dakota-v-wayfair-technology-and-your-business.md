Today I published a post on the Hashrocket blog titled 'South Dakota v.
Wayfair, Technology, and Your Business'. It covers a unique technological
problem, and a solution I helped build as a part of in my consulting work.
Here's the summary:

> If you sell goods or services online, you may have heard of the Supreme Court
> case South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. In this post, I'll discuss the impact of
> this case on online goods and service providers from a technological
> perspective, and solutions I have helped implement for Hashrocket's clients.
