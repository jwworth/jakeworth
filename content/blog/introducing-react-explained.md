Today, I'd like to introduce my newest project, a free weekly newsletter for
React learners called [React Explained][re]. ðŸŽ‰

For as long as React has existed, I've been a fan. And I'm also a big reader of
curated developer newsletters, from Ruby, PostgreSQL, and JavaScript Weekly, to
Elixir Weekly, Elixir Radar, and Inside AI.

I also found React difficult to learn when I was first starting out. Despite
React's compact API, it is built on a handful of revolutionary ideas. In my
role as a mentor at [Code Platoon][cp], I've watched others struggle to learn
React, again and again. For many people, it just doesn't click right away.

I did a survey of the landscape and concluded that the existing newsletters in
the React space aren't geared for beginners. I want to help somebody learning
React today, in 2020â€“ a person who is overwhelmed by the rapid growth of the
ecosystem and tons of shared context in the community.

I decided to start React Explained to help developers who want to get up to
speed on React and learn what it's all about in 2020. Join me!

[Subscribe today][re], and follow us on [Twitter][twitter]. I'd love to hear
what you think.

Thanks for reading.
