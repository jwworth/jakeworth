A while back I tackled the following programming challenge:

> From One End to the Other: Find the smallest possible
> (positive) integer that ends in a six such that if that six is removed and
> placed in front of the remaining digits of the number, the resulting number
> will be four times as large as the original.

My solution is below, and here:

I like that this solution is relatively fast, at 0.36 seconds. I like that it doesn't imply what the answer might be by having a ceiling to the searchâ€” the code will run forever if my conditional is wrong. I like that it uses the `rotate` method, something I didn't know existed until I tried to solve this problem.

I don't like that this code isn't tested, and that it turns the integer into a string. String manipulation is one of the best features of Ruby, but I rely on it too often.

This code came after a major refactor, viewable in the Gist history. My first draft arrived at the same solution, but telegraphed the answer via a range, which is a little misleading. Ironically, this is closer to the type of code I would have written when I was just getting started as a programmer. I didn't know how to find the answer first then, so I had to write code that made zero assumptions.

```ruby
# from_one_end_to_the_other.rb

i = 6
loop do
  digits = i.to_s.split('')
  if digits.last == '6' && digits.rotate(-1).join.to_i == (i * 4)
    puts i
    break
  end
  i = i + 2
end

# 153846
```

For the curious, I also solved this in Elm. No syntax highlighting available at the time of posting, so enjoy the bleeding edge:

```elm
import Graphics.Element exposing (show)
import Array exposing (..)
import String exposing (..)

magicNumber : Array Int
magicNumber =
  let
    isNumber number =  
      String.right 1 (toString(number)) == "6" &&
      (String.append "6" (String.dropRight 1 (toString(number))))
        == toString(number * 4)
        
  in
    Array.filter isNumber (initialize 100000 (\n -> n * 2))
  
main = show magicNumber
-- Array.fromList [153846]
```

And finally, here is my solution in Lua:

```lua
function swap_first_and_last(t, n)
  table.insert(t, 1, n)
  return tonumber(table.concat(t))
end

for i = 6, 1000000, 2 do
  local digits = {}
  local count = 1

  for x in string.gmatch(tostring(i), "%S") do
    table.insert(digits, count, x)
    count = count + 1
  end

  local last = table.remove(digits)

  if last == "6" and swap_first_and_last(digits, last) == i * 4 then
    print(i)
    os.exit()
  end
end

-- 153846
```

I'm still a Rubyist! Thanks to Josh Branchaud for posting this challenge.
