I'm writing a blog post series about preparing technical talks, here are the five parts:

1. [How I Talk](/how-i-talk)
1. [Finding an idea](/how-i-talk-finding-an-idea)
1. [Brainstorming](/how-i-talk-brainstorming)
1. [Researching and preparing slides](/how-i-talk-researching-and-preparing-slides)
1. [Practice and Delivery](/how-i-talk-practice-and-delivery)


Today, I'll be covering the third step of my process: researching and preparing
slides.

### Research

When possible, I start in an unusual place for tech: the library. Libraries
contain a wealth of information on many technical subjects. Connecting a
topical web development subject to the history of computers or human inquiry is
something Sandi Metz, a speaker I admire and emulate, does well. Even when the
material isn't there waiting to be found, there's always something, as well as
professionals who can help you devise a research strategy.

Technical talks, often mislabeled 'hard' talks, are what I prepare most often.
They require experimentation. I use the ideas I found during
[brainstorming](/how-i-talk-brainstorming) to try a lot of experiments in my
text editor or REPL. Which are worth explaining?

### Preparing Slides

After trying PowerPoint, Keynote, and even Vim buffers navigated
with `]f` and `[f` (an idea I borrowed from Steve Klabnik; not recommended unless
you're an unflappable speaker), I discovered [Deckset](https://www.decksetapp.com/).

Deckset is a feature-rich markdown slide builder, and I love it. If you know
markdown, Deckset is fantastic. It lets me crank out ideas and
proofs-of-concept right in my editor. If you feel that the hardest part of
preparing a talk is putting together the visuals and notes you need to speak, then Deckset is worth trying.

As for slide design, I follow the guidelines put forth in
[Speaking.io](http://speaking.io) and the Chicago Ruby speaking guidelines. To summarize: 

1. Make your text as big as you can.
1. Use the most basic code examples that you can.
1. Use high contrast colors, like black text on a white background. Subtle palettes like Zenburn don't work on a projector.
1. Don't show code unless you want your audience to read every line; they will.

My talks don't feature funny GIFs, pictures, or video. Why? I don't trust
myself to be funny, and don't want to invest any of the time I have to prepare
on that quadrant. It's a strategy.

I structure my talks like essays, with an introduction, thesis, 3-4 supporting
points, and a conclusion. Formulaic, but it works.

Something I often ponder is: could this be a blog post? One of the less
effective types of presentations could be summarized as a person reading a blog
post they wrote. A telltale sign of such a talk is when the speaker concludes
with a link to a blog post with the same title as the talk. I've given a few
like this that I didn't love. A good talk isn't a recipe for solving some
narrow problem, it's a performance that would fall flat on a page.

### Conclusion

Researching and preparing the slides is a unique process and these ideas have
worked for me in the past. Experimenting and automating my process has helped
me to develop talks that are detailed and hopefully interesting to
watch.

Next up in this series, I'll be covering the step that I think defines all
great talks: practice.
