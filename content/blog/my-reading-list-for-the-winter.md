Inspired by [this post](https://practicingdeveloper.com/2016/11/04/0040-my-reading-list-for-the-winter/) by Gregory Brown, I'd like to share the books I'm planning to read in the cold Chicago winter. By diving into these resources, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of my work.

1) *Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software Paperback* â€“ Charles Petzold

**Why?** I want to understand programming and computer science on a more fundamental level; to understand today's practices as part of a larger tradition.

2) *Programming Elixir 1.3: Functional |> Concurrent |> Pragmatic |> Fun* - Dave Thomas

**Why?** I've been learning Elixir for a while now, and love it. I aim to get a deeper perspective on the language and familiarize myself with the canonical books currently available.

3) *Code Complete: A Practical Handbook of Software Construction* - Steve McConnell

**Why?** This book has been recommended to me many times! It's time. I want to be exposed to the best practices from across the industry, not just what's popular in the Ruby and JavaScript communities. Doing so will make me a better developer and consultant.

That's it! Thanks for reading. If you've read any of these books, I'd love to talk along the way. I'll be sharing what I learn at [Today I Learned](https://til.hashrocket.com), this blog, and the [Hashrocket Blog](https://hashrocket.com/blog).
