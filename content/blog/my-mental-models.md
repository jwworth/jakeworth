A mental model is an explanation of someone's thought process about how
something works. Because everything we do as programmers, except flipping
physical bits, is abstract, mental models are one of a programmer's most
cherished possessions.

I enjoy reading my old blog posts and recognizing how my mental models have
evolved. Here are a few of my current models, and how I'd describe them to a
colleague.

### Models

**Anchoring.** The first number spoken aloud in a story pointing sets the
[Overton window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window) for the
discussion. If you want accurate pointing informed by everyone in the room, not
just the extroverts, consider some form of planning poker. Here's [a
technique](https://hashrocket.com/blog/posts/planning-poker-speed-mode) I've
used.

**Fuel, Air, or Spark.** When an internal combustion engine isn't starting,
one of three ingredients is absent: fuel, air, or spark. Each of these
subsystems is complex on its own. Before you look into any them, inspect the
final output of each. If you jump right to a subsystem, you'll risk
troubleshooting parts of the engine that are working.

**The Iceberg Secret.** Programmers know that what we can see on a web page can
represent a small fraction or none of the true functionality, completeness, and
complexity of the application. People who don't write software don't
automatically know that.

**Prioritization.** Once you can deliver consistent quality in your
programming, there is no concept of moving 'faster.' You can only change your
prioritization. Focus on the user and ruthlessly eliminate busywork and bike
shedding.

**Survivorship Bias.** A practical example: a hiring process that consistently
delivers good people isn't necessarily good; you have to consider good people
who did not make it through the process.

### Conclusion

Thanks for reading. I'll be updating and augmenting this post in the future.
