For the next 97 days, I'll be doing the [100 Days of Code](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge. I vow to code for at least an hour every day until mid-December, unless I'm exhausted or forget. 

My goals for this project are to:

1. Rapidly level-up in my skills. This happened with both [60 Days 60 Contributions](/60-days-60-contributions) and [60 Days 60 Hacks](/60-days-60-hacks), and it's been about two years since I've done such a challenge.
2. Wander into the more esoteric realms of this field that interest me.

Possible areas of study include: language design, statically typed JavaScript (Flow, TypeScript, ReasonML), automated content creation, and understanding my operating system better. I'm open to any idea that pops into my head.
