This week I'll be using a weekly [standup][standup] format: what I did this
week, what I plan to do next week, and issues I'm encountering.

### This Week

This week I added a new payment provider to my project. The work was a mix of
coding, testing, design and branding, and lots of documentation.

I spent about ten productive hours working on my side project. I also did a
small amount of thinking about mobile architecture for the startup I'm
advising.

I loved these posts about `try` and the Law of Demeter from Avdi Grimm.

- [Do, or do not. There is no #try.][try]
- [Demeter: It’s not just a good idea. It’s the law.][demeter]

I also mapped my full-screen screenshot command to `PrtSc` (which I have
on my keyboard) and set my screenshot default location to a `Screenshots/`
folder on the Desktop. Now I can take screenshots with one button without
cluttering my Desktop.

I loved discovering the concept of [Chesterton's Fence][chesterton] this week.
To summarize:

> A core component of making great decisions is understanding the rationale
> behind previous decisions. If we don’t understand how we got “here,” we run
> the risk of making things much worse.

A cherished piece of advice I picked up right before becoming a platoon leader
in combat: wait 30 days before making any big changes. Everything people do in
a warzone is for a reason. Work hard to understand it.

### Next Week

Next week I'll be continuing to work on payments and auth, while meeting more
of my team members. As I get more established and confident, I plan to start
addressing tech debt issues.

### Issues

None of significance.

### Parting Thought
