Each year I conduct an annual review to help me reflect on the ending year. Here's this year's entry.

#### News

This was an important year for me professionally; here's a summary of what I did:

- Built a private inventory management app for a nonprofit (not open source or
  public at the moment)
- Spoke at [ElixirDaze 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwphyQmD6n8)
- Stayed on the same project for a year, deeply exploring React, Redux, Gatsby,
  GraphQL, slicing, testing, and the JS ecosystem. Learned new communication
  techniques from the extended relationship with this team
- Spoke at the React Chicago and Atlanta Elixir Meetups. Organized 10 Vim
  Chicago Meetups
- Attended Chicago JS Camp 2018 and React Boston 2018
- Wrote a handful of blog posts for my blog and the Hashrocket blog
- Served as a formal mentor for the fall cohort of [Code Platoon](https://www.codeplatoon.org/), which was awesome!
- Started
  [#100DaysofCode](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23100DaysOfCode%20from%3Ajwworth)
  (in progress). Built two programming languages, shipped some
  projects, became obsessed with TypeScript
- Celebrated four years at Hashrocket ðŸŽ‚

#### Last Year's Goal

My professional goal for 2018 was to submit 10 proposals to technical
conferences. That number was based on my previous 1/10 proposal acceptance
rate.

This did not go as planned; the first proposal I submitted was
accepted to ElixirDaze 2018. I summarized that wonderful experience for
the [Hashrocket
Blog](https://hashrocket.com/blog/posts/journey-to-elixirdaze-2018). TL;DR: code formatters
are good and you should use them!

For me, speaking at conferences is exhilarating but daunting, and after going
through that experience again so early in the year, I decided to refrain from
submitting any more proposals in 2018. Unless I start repeating talks or
develop a more improvisational style, one conference per year seems to be my
limit.

#### This Year's Goal

This year I plan to pivot to a single mantra: *ship*.

I want to get good at turning the river of ideas I have into products. Some
will be silly demos and jokes, some will be open source libraries I plan to
maintain, and some will be products in production.

I'd want to move away from "learning for learning's sake" and start learning by facing the
real challenges of shipping. I want the exhaust of my learning in public to be tangible
products that people use to improve their lives.

In that spirit, here's my first app of 2019, 'Opening Day Progress Bar'. The
point of this app was to think of a solution to an actual problem for me-- a
frequent curiosity to understand how far away MLB opening day is from today--
that was small enough that I could storycard, build, and ship it to production
in a couple of hours. I also wanted it to be JavaScript, have good SEO
metadata, and be performant, progressive, and just modern code.

Here's to more shipping in 2019.

#### Thanks

Thanks to everyone at Hashrocket, my Meetup crew, clients, family, and friends
for making this year memorable.
