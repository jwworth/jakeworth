Yes, as stable as any other job.

If you look at three of the most common kind of web development positions—
product shop, consulting, and freelance— the risk of unemployment is more about
the type of company, than the work itself.

Product shops come in sizes large and small. If you work for a small company,
like a startup, your job security is volatile. The company could run out of
money, shut down, or be sold and reorganized. But this risk applies to anybody
working at such a company, including product managers, designers, copywriters,
marketers, human resources, etc. And it applies to anybody working at any small
business.

Consulting job security relies on a number of factors, including venture
funding and market demand. Again, these are not factors that just affect
developers.

Freelance work is unstable by its very nature. You have a contract, and you
keep that contract with some luck and by doing good work and meeting client
expectations. Sometimes you don’t have a contract.

From my experience, developers are much more likely to leave a company on their
own out of boredom or shifting personal interests than to be let go or fired.

On the whole, web development and tech jobs in general are predicted to grow in
the next decade. If you are risk adverse, look for a job at a large,
established product shop. Most importantly, keep developing your hard and soft
skills and you will find ample web development opportunities wherever you go.
