I took last week off.

Here's my weekly review; I'm borrowing [Ben Kuhn's](https://www.benkuhn.net/)
format. Check out his blogâ€“ it's amazing.

### Opening Thought

--Thomas Edison

### Consistency

_Was I consistent at my core habits this week? How can I tweak them to be more
consistent or more useful?_

I've been maintaining an Engineering Daybook months, and this week I kept it up
to date. I alternate between Cornell Notes, Bullet Journalling, and
borderline-legible scribbles. I'd like to be consistent with my format.

Starting out on a new work computer without any of my stuff is refreshing.

I tried a technique this week for a new project: taking screenshots of
meetings, presentations, terminal sessions, important screens, etc. When
onboarding, I struggle to simultaneously take notes and pay attention, perhaps
because I don't always know what's important so I annotate everything. I'm
hoping that reviewing these screenshots on a periodic basis will help me
remember what I've seen, and cut down on the ground I need to re-tread.

I brought my Hashrocket commit habits, [PR
habits](https://hashrocket.com/blog/posts/github-pull-request-and-issue-templates),
[code review habits](https://conventionalcomments.org/), and devops habits to
my new project. It's a set of skills that I'm proud to have honed.

### Mistakes

_What did I do this week that was a mistake and how can I avoid repeating it?_

I offered a PR for review that changed more lines of code than necessary.
Bottom line: I believe PR's should be surgical. On large projects with normal
turnover, that Git history is invaluable. Don't step on it without a great
reason.

I did not deliver an issue of [React
Explained](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/react-explained) this week as
planned. My hours have changed and I'm not sure when I'm going to be able to do
my newsletter going forward. I'd like to figure that out before the next
issue.

### Comparative Advantage

_How much of this week did I spend on stuff that was truly my comparative
advantage? For everything else, how can I get out of the loop?_

ðŸ’— This week after 6.5 years of use, I weaned myself off the [Hashrocket
Dotmatrix](https://github.com/hashrocket/dotmatrix). It was difficult! I think
this will be to my advantage because I'll deepen my configuration skills, I
won't be dependant on other (stellar) people to maintain my environment, and I
won't be loading code that I don't use. Losing access to that hive-mind is
hard, but I plan to visit the repo frequently.

I read the official Spree docs this week, and a summary of the core business of
my new team. Those little investments always pay off.

Finally, I set up a new M1 Mac with the help of
[Rosetta](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25204824). Upgrading from a 2014
to a 2021 MBP is going to make me a faster developer.

I set up Exhuberant Ctags on my new machine, using this [blog
post](https://galea.medium.com/getting-started-with-ctags-vim-on-macos-87bcb07cf6d),
then added [gem-ctags](https://github.com/tpope/gem-ctags) with
[bundler.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-bundler). Confidence in library
source is a hallmark of a senior programmer and I'm pleased to be leveling up.

### Action Items

- Remind myself to scope PR's to the smallest change

Thanks for reading.
