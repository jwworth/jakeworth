Recently I started writing a Node module, and I realized I wanted unit tests
and type safety from the start. This led to a spin-off project, which I'm
calling TypeScript Node Module Starter. It's available here:

https://github.com/jwworth/typescript-node-module-starter

The project description is: 'Kick off a new Node module, with TypeScript and
Jest included.'

Tests and type safety are important to me, especially in JavaScript, but these
tools can be tricky to set up. This eliminates that process, while adding
package info and a license.

Now, I just need to get started on the actual Node module. ðŸš€
