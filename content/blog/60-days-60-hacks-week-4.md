title: '60 Days 60 Hacks Week 4'

I'm now one month into my learning project #60days60hacks.

The bulk of my writing is now going into [Today I Learned](http://til.hashrocket.com/), a project I'll explain in greater detail in a forthcoming post. I'm still keeping the Github repo updated with posts I find personally significant.

This week I learned:

* How to rebase to the root commit of a project
* How to use the Rails `classify` and `constantize` methods for metaprogramming class names
* How to invert a Ruby hash
* How to remove a Rails `belongs_to` association
* How to rapidly replace ERB files with HAML
* How to use a block with `find_or_create_by`
* How to ignore code that is run by a required file
* How to edit the current file always in Vim

My work this week focused on the 'Today I Learned' app, working through the Neo Ruby Koans, and building a Node.js app to generate random Halo teams in Slack, to support our lunchtime (and after work) Halo matches. I also got deeper into a volunteer project I've been working on, cleaning up code and adding integration tests.

All of these efforts have been fertile ground for producing 'Today I Learned' content. The recurring theme has been that Ruby, Rails, and Vim are extremely powerful tools that reward continual pondering and exploration.
