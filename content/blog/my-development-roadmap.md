I've been working on a development roadmap for my projects, and wanted to share
my process.

Consider this a recipe to turn an idea into software. The purpose of codifying
a workflow like this is to make working with me a predictable and thorough
experience. Writing software is pretty hard; it's much harder when you don't
have a plan.

Every item here is Ã  la carteâ€“ I wouldn't typically do more, but I might do
less on projects of modest scope.

### Introduction

My process takes heavy inspiration from the following outstanding resources:

- https://www.fullstacklabs.co/playbook
- https://thoughtbot.com/playbook

Here are the steps.

### Design Discovery

What kind of design expectations are we beholden to, or do we aspire to?
The deliverable is a written document via Google Docs or Basecamp.

### Kickoff Meeting

The first of only a few real meetings! Here's a great overview of this process
from [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/kickoff-meeting-agenda).
The deliverable is a productive meeting and notes with action items from the meeting.

### Competitive Analysis

What are the other folks doing? The deliverable is an Airtable spreadsheet.

### User personas

Who are our users? We'll brainstorm demographic data about them. The deliverable is
an Airtable spreadsheet.

### Technical Discovery

What kind of technology do we want to use? Which [choose boring
technologies][boring] are we going to use, and are we planning to spend any
innovation credits? The deliverable is a written document.

### UX Design

We'll build a feature map and user flow in Whimsical, and wireframes via Sketch.

### UI Design

We'll produce style concepts and a style guide via Sketch, and high-fidelity
mockups via Sketch Cloud.

### Prototyping and Estimation

If we haven't already, we'll make a high-fidelity clickable prototypes via
Sketch Cloud. Then, we'll do development estimates via storycarding, using Vim
Slurper, BDD syntax, and Pivotal Tracker. Finally, we may make a development
proposal, a written document in Basecamp or Google Docs.

### Development

Time to write the code! This entire blog summarizes how I'd handle this phase.
We'll be doing Agile, iterative development, with daily standups, refinement,
estimation, planning, development, delivery, and retrospectives. The
deliverable is the universe-denting software. When we're finished, we'll
launch! ðŸš€

### Conclusion

That's it! I plan to update the workflow periodically as I continue to ship and refine.
