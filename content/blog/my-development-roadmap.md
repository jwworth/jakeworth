I've been working on a development roadmap for my projects, and wanted to share
my process.

Consider this a recipe to turn an idea into software. The purpose of codifying
a workflow like this is to make working with me a predictable and thorough
experience. Writing software is pretty hard; it's a much harder when you don't
have a plan.

Everything item here Ã  la carteâ€“ I wouldn't typically do more, but I might do
less on projects of modest scope.

### Introduction

My process takes heavy inspiration from the following resources:

Check them out.

### Development Roadmap

Here are the steps.

1. Design Discovery: what kind of design expectations are we beholden to, or do we aspire to? Deliverable: written document.
2. Kickoff Meeting: here's an applicable resource from [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/kickoff-meeting-agenda).
3. Competitive Analysis: what are the other folks doing? Deliverable: spreadsheet.
4. User personas: who are our users? We'll brainstorm demographic data about them. Deliverable: spreadsheet.
5. Technical Discovery: What kind of technology do we want to use? Deliverable: written document.
6. UX Design: Feature map, user flow, wireframes. Deliverables: physical or digital whiteboard, Sketch files.
7. UI Design: Style concepts, style guide, high fidelity mockups. Deliverables: Sketch files or PDF.
8. Prototyping and Estimation: High-fidelity clickable prototypes, development estimates via storycarding, development proposal. Deliverables: sketch files or PDF, tickets, written document.
9. Development: Writing the code. Sprints, standups, refinement, estimation, planning, dev, delivery, retros. Deliverables: the software.
10. Launch! ðŸš€


### Conclusion

That's it! I plan to update the workflow periodically as I continue to ship and
refine.
