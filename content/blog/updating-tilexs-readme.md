Today was day one of the [Code Quality Challenge](https://www.codequalitychallenge.com/). I think it's a great professional challenge and am excited to be in the first cohort.

For each exercise, I'll be working on [Tilex](https://github.com/hashrocket/tilex). The first day was titled 'Improve your README', so that's what I worked on this morning.

Documentation is a reliable indicator of the quality of a project. My changes today were geared toward clarity and generalizing information for people of every experience level and working in every environment. I try to forget what I know about a project while writing the documentation; it’s not easy, but that’s the goal.

Here's the [pull request](https://github.com/hashrocket/tilex/pull/209) where my changes were presented, and the [README](https://github.com/hashrocket/tilex/blob/master/README.md).
