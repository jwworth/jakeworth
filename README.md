This is the source code for my developer's blog, available here:

https://www.jakeworth.com

Here's my intention, from the [first post](http://www.jakeworth.com/hello-world):

> I’ve been writing code for a few years now, and am proud to be launching my own
> developer’s blog.
>
> The developer’s blog is a time-honored tradition in the world of software, and
> I am indebted to the many great programmers whose blogs I read.  Our community
> is incredible at sharing information.  My goal with this blog is to provide
> something of similar value, while building a record of the solutions I've found
> for future reference.
>
> I am a web developer working in Ruby on Rails, but am interested in a broad
> range of topics, including responsive design, performance, testing, database
> management, continuous integration, source control, open source contribution
> and operating systems, automation, 'startup life', and much more.  I hope to
> use this platform to share the challenges and triumphs I’ve experienced in
> front of a computer screen.  Thank you for reading.
