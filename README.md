# [jakeworth][production-url]

This is the source code for my developer's blog. It is forked from the [Gatsby blog
starter][blog-starter].

Here's my intention, from the [first post][first-post].

> I've been writing code for a few years now, and am proud to be launching my
> own developer's blog.
>
> The developerâ€™s blog is a time-honored tradition in the world of software,
> and I am indebted to the many great programmers whose blogs I read. Our
> community is incredible at sharing information. My goal with this blog is to
> provide something of similar value, while building a record of the solutions
> I've found for future reference.
>
> I am a web developer working in Ruby on Rails, but am interested in a broad
> range of topics, including responsive design, performance, testing, database
> management, continuous integration, source control, open source contribution
> and operating systems, automation, 'startup life', and much more. I hope to
> use this platform to share the challenges and triumphs I've experienced in
> front of a computer screen. Thank you for reading.
